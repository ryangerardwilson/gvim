# gtkv

`gtkv` is a GTK4 block-based editor that keeps Vim as the editor. Text and
images live in separate blocks, and text blocks open in an external terminal
Vim session for full editing power. Documents are stored as a single `.docv`
SQLite file. 3D blocks render with WebKitGTK using a bundled Three.js module.

---

## Requirements

- GTK4 runtime libraries.
- PyGObject + GObject Introspection (for running from source).
- A terminal Vim (`nvim`, `vim`, or `vi`).
- Optional: the `o` file picker for save path selection.
- Optional: WebKitGTK for 3D blocks.
- Optional: Python + Matplotlib for Python render blocks.
- Optional: WebKitGTK for LaTeX blocks (bundled KaTeX assets).
- Bundled: `three.module.min.js` is included for 3D blocks.

## Installation

### Prebuilt binary (Linux x86_64)

Grab the latest tagged release via the helper script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryangerardwilson/gtkv/main/install.sh | bash
```

The script drops the unpacked bundle into `~/.gtkv/app` and a shim in
`~/.gtkv/bin`. It will attempt to append that directory to your `PATH` (unless
you opt out). Once installed, run `gtkv -h` to confirm everything works.

Installer flags of note:

- `-v <x.y.z>`: install a specific tagged release (`v0.2.0`, etc.).
- `-v` (no argument): print the latest GitHub release version.
- `-u`: reinstall only if GitHub has something newer than your current local copy.
- `-b /path/to/gtkv-linux-x64.tar.gz`: install from an already-downloaded archive.
- `-h`: show installer usage.

You can also download the `gtkv-linux-x64.tar.gz` artifact manually from the
releases page and run `install.sh --binary` if you prefer to manage the bundle
yourself.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ryangerardwilson/gtkv.git
cd gtkv
python main.py
```

## Usage

- `gtkv` — start the editor.
- `gtkv doc.docv` — open an existing document.
- `Ctrl+V` — append a new text block.
- `Ctrl+3` — insert a 3D block and edit its Three.js HTML in Vim.
- `Ctrl+P` — insert a Python render block (SVG output).
- `Ctrl+L` — insert a LaTeX block rendered with KaTeX.
- `j/k` — move between blocks.
- `Enter` — open the selected text or 3D block in Vim.
- Exit Vim — refreshes the block content in GTK.
- `Ctrl+S` — save the current document (prompts for a path on first save).
- `-v` — print installed version.
- `-u` — upgrade to the latest release.
- `-h` — show CLI help.

### Bash completion

The installer drops a completion script into
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/bash_completion.d/gtkv` and adds a loader to
`~/.bashrc` if needed.

## Notes

- Blocks are separate; there is no inline mixing.
- Vim runs externally in your terminal; GTK stays focused on layout.
- Documents are stored as text `.docv` files suitable for Git diffing.
- 3D blocks store their HTML/JS source inside the `.docv` file.
- Python render blocks execute via a configured Python path and must write to `__gtkv__.renderer`.
- Python render output is rendered at runtime (not embedded).
- LaTeX blocks render via KaTeX in a WebKit view with local assets.

### `.docv` text format

Blocks are stored as plain text with block headers (SQLite is no longer used):

```
# GTKV v2
::text
My notes...

::three
<three.js html>

::pyimage
format: svg
<python source>

::latex
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
```

## Releases

Tag the repository with the desired semantic version and push:

```bash
git tag v0.4.0
git push origin v0.4.0
```

GitHub Actions builds a source bundle (`gtkv-linux-x64.tar.gz`), updates
`_version.py`, and publishes the asset alongside the tagged release.
